Create a deck of 30 cards for the Hero you want to play
Shuffle the cards into a random order, and put them into the draw pile
Find an opponent who does not have the same Hero as you
Flip a coin after you and your opponent decide on heads or tails
If you lost the coin toss, you go second  If you won, you go first
If you lost, wait for your opponent to play their turn  If you won, you will have 1 mana, so play a card costing 1 mana if available
If you do not have a card costing 1 mana, end your turn
Let your opponent play their next turn
Now upon your 2nd turn, look for a minion or spell card costing 2 mana, and play it   If you have the mana coin from going second, play the mana coin for a 3 cost card, or save it for later
If you have a "taunt" minion, prioritze it  If you do not, skip this step
If you played a card on your first turn, and survived, use them to attack the enemy hero now  If you did not play a card on turn 1, end your turn
Now wait for your opponent to play their turn
If your opponent played minions that turn, you should use your existing minions to kill theirs  If your opponent has no minions, use your minions to deal more damage to their hero
Now that it is turn 3, you should certainly have enough mana to use your hero power this turn
If you played Warrior, use the power to gain 2 armor    If you played Mage, use the power to deal 1 damage to the enemy Hero
If you played Shaman, use the power to get a random boost totem  If you played Paladin, use the power to summon a 1 HP 1 Attack minion
If you played Hunter, use the power to deal 2 damage to the enemy Hero  If you played Priest, you may heal yourself if you took damage
If you played Warlock, use the power to draw a card  If you played Druid, use the power to equip a weapon, and use it to attack this turn
If you played Rogue, use your power to get a 1 Durability, 1 Damage weapon, and attack this turn  If you did not play Rogue, continue to the next step
If you have any remaining mana, you may have on a spell, or minion  If you have no mana, end your turn
On the rest of your turns, continue the strategy of playing minions, and using your hero ability
